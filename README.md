## How to build

The paper also comes as a single ``latex`` file ``Paper.tex``, which is built as a PDF as follows.

```
git clone https://github.com/6998/ml-runner-paper.git
cd ml-runner-paper
./build.sh
```
This will create a PDF version of the Yellow Paper. Following building, you can also use standard `pdflatex` tools like http://latex.informatik.uni-halle.de/latex-online/latex.php for compiling/preview.
